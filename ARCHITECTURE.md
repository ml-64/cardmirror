# Architecture

Design decisions for the prosemirror-debate editor. This file captures the
*editor's* design choices — schema shape, rendering model, multi-doc
architecture, integration boundaries. Verbatim's own data model lives in
[`NOTES-verbatim.md`](./NOTES-verbatim.md); macro effects we're trying to
replicate live in [`NOTES-custom-macros.md`](./NOTES-custom-macros.md).

---

## 1. Why ProseMirror

ProseMirror represents documents as a *typed tree*: every node has a `type`
declared by the schema, optional `attrs`, optional ordered child `content`
governed by a content expression, and optional `marks` (inline decorations
on text). Schema-violating transactions are rejected by construction.

This is a meaningful step up from a flat-paragraphs-with-styles model
(Word's, Quill's) for our use case because **debate documents are
genuinely tree-shaped**: Pocket > Hat > Block > Tag/Card is a real
hierarchy with semantics, not just visual indentation. When `card` is a
real node in the tree, operations target it as an object — select, move,
duplicate, query — without re-deriving its boundaries from style
sequences. That's the core leverage we're buying.

What ProseMirror *doesn't* give us for free: docx fidelity, debate
ergonomics, multi-doc coordination, read-mode UX. Those are work we do
on top of the substrate.

## 2. Project decomposition

The natural separation:

```
[Stylepox normalizer]  →  [docx]  →  [Importer]  →  [Schema]  ↔  [Editor]
                                                       ↓
                                                  [Exporter]  →  [docx]
```

- **Stylepox normalizer** — genuinely separate project. The project owner
  already maintains a working tool (Stylepox Cleaner) for legacy file
  remediation; not in scope for us.
- **Schema + Importer + Exporter + Editor** — single project, deeply
  intertwined. The schema is shared infrastructure; importer and exporter
  are 1:1 coupled to it; the editor consumes it.

Round-trip is a *quality property* of the schema/importer/exporter triple,
not a separable codebase. The schema must be designed against round-trip
realities from day one, not retrofitted.

### Build order

1. **Schema first** — small, defensible, designed against the realities
   in `NOTES-verbatim.md` §6.
2. **Exporter** — schema → OOXML, tested by hand-constructing schema trees
   and verifying the docx renders correctly in Word + Advanced Verbatim.
3. **Importer alongside** — OOXML → schema, tested via
   `doc → import → export → doc` round-trip on the example docs.
4. **Editor on top** — once the schema is proven sound under round-trip,
   build the editing UX.

Unusual ordering for an editor project; justified because *the persistence
is the entire reason the project exists*.

## 3. The round-trip contract (fungibility)

Headline goal: **a user of our editor on a Verbatim-using team is a fully
equal participant in the file ecosystem**. Documents shipped from our
editor are visually and semantically indistinguishable from
Verbatim-produced docs, regardless of how the sender's editor is
configured. Documents received from Verbatim users round-trip back through
Verbatim cleanly.

Concretely:

- **Aggressive cleanup on import is OK.** We are *not* required to
  preserve arbitrary cruft. Stylepox, abandoned custom styles, irrelevant
  hyperlinks, font/spacing overrides — all fair to normalize.
- **Verbatim and Advanced Verbatim semantics must be preserved with full
  fidelity.** Anything Verbatim's macros key on must round-trip. The
  inventory in `NOTES-verbatim.md` and `NOTES-custom-macros.md` is the
  authoritative list.
- **Exports look native.** Style names, outline levels, document
  variables, and direct-formatting conventions must match what Verbatim
  itself produces. The receiver should not be able to tell our editor
  was involved.

The version of the round-trip property we are *not* committing to: byte
equivalence. Word docx files are not byte-stable across saves anyway
(rsids, generation timestamps, etc.). Semantic equivalence is what we own.

## 4. Schema shape

Working sketch — to be refined as we build. The structural skeleton:

```
doc:           sequence of block-level kinds (flat)
pocket:        Heading 1 paragraph (inline content, stable id)
hat:           Heading 2 paragraph (inline content, stable id)
block:         Heading 3 paragraph (inline content, stable id)
card:          tag undertag* (cite_paragraph | analytic)? card_body*
analytic_unit: analytic undertag* card_body*
tag:           inline+      (only inside card)
analytic:      inline+      (inside analytic_unit, or in-card cite slot)
undertag:      inline+
cite_paragraph, card_body: inline body paragraphs inside cards
paragraph:     inline*      (unstyled body text — implicit Normal)
```

Notes:

- **Top-level is a sequence**, not a singular root. Real `.docx` files
  contain multiple "files" separated by empty Heading1 paragraphs (e.g.
  `DA - Reconciliation.docx` carries both DA and CP). The schema embraces
  this rather than fighting it.
- **Heading-level nodes are flat**, not tree containers. Hierarchy
  (which cards sit under which Block, which Block under which Hat, etc.)
  is implicit in document order + outline level — not enforced by
  schema containment. The nav panel walks the flat sequence and groups
  by outline level to derive the tree view. See `DECISIONS.md`
  2026-05-08 "Schema design — heading-level nodes are flat paragraphs."
- **Pocket is optional at root.** `CP - Bifurcation PIC vs Fed Workers.docx`
  has zero Heading1 paragraphs. Top-level entry can be Hat, Block, or
  a plain paragraph.
- **Plain `paragraph` block** is a first-class block-level type for
  unstyled body text. Real docs frequently contain unstyled paragraphs
  interspersed with structured content (especially in speech docs);
  the schema admits them directly at any position. This subsumes the
  earlier "scratchpad" escape hatch — a region of loose paragraphs and
  headings *is* the natural shape, not an exception that needs special
  wrapping. We deliberately do **not** auto-classify by heading title
  (e.g. "Patch Notes", "Cutting Board"). The project owner uses such
  conventions personally but they're not community-wide; baking them
  into import logic would mis-handle other users' files.
- **Marks** for inline emphasis: `cite_mark`, `underline_mark`,
  `emphasis_mark`, `undertag_mark`, plus direct-formatting marks
  `highlight(color)`, `font_size(pt)`, `bold`, `italic`, `font_color`,
  `shading(color)`, and `link(href)` for hyperlinks (URLs are the
  common case; intra-doc links to bookmarked headings are supported
  for completeness — see §12 on heading IDs).
- **Stable heading IDs.** Every heading-level node (`pocket`, `hat`,
  `block`, `tag`, `analytic` when it owns a paragraph) carries an
  `attrs.id` UUID, generated when the heading is created and preserved
  through all subsequent edits. Required by transclusion (§12) so that
  references survive heading renames and body edits. Round-tripped to
  docx as bracketing `<w:bookmarkStart w:name="..."/>` /
  `<w:bookmarkEnd/>` markers around the heading paragraph — Word's
  native mechanism for stable named locations, well-tolerated by
  Verbatim's cleanup passes.
- **Linked paragraph + character pair** (Analytic, Undertag, Cite) is
  handled by exposing each as *both* a block node and a mark. The source
  XML chooses the representation: `<w:pStyle w:val="Analytic"/>` →
  block node; `<w:rStyle w:val="AnalyticChar"/>` → mark. Export
  reverses.
- **The dual-encoding of Underline** (named style + direct
  `Font.Underline` property) must be preserved on export — Verbatim's own
  code keys on both. Same caution for `undertag_mark` and italic for
  parity.
- **Pilcrow** — a special inline node that exports as a 6pt ¶ glyph;
  represents a soft paragraph boundary inside a condensed card. Not
  observed in working drafts (the Condense feature is rare in the
  example docs), so low priority for v1, but the schema slot should
  exist.
- **Reading-position markers are just plain styled text**, not a
  special schema node. When the reader stops mid-card, an action in
  read mode inserts visible text (e.g. "Marked 7:32") at the cursor
  position with a distinguishing color (matching Verbatim's red-text
  convention from `Paperless.SendToSpeech`). The marker round-trips
  trivially because it's regular text in a regular paragraph. It's
  intentionally visible — readable by anyone who opens the doc, so
  other round participants can reference it.

## 5. Three-layer rendering model

Verbatim conflates content and visual styling — styles live inside each
docx, so changing display means changing every doc, and shipping a doc
ships your display preferences with it. We separate the layers:

1. **Schema** — structural types only. Does not specify rendering.
2. **Display config** — per-user, per-machine. Maps each schema node and
   mark to render parameters (font, size, color, weight, italic, spacing,
   indent, line-height, etc.). Stored as a per-user JSON; never touches
   any document.
3. **Direct formatting** — normal editing operation that overrides
   defaults on a specific node. Ships with the doc as part of the doc.

The export contract:

- Schema-typed structure → canonical Verbatim style definitions
  (`Heading4` for Tag, `Style13ptBold` for Cite, etc.).
- Direct formatting → run/paragraph properties on those styles, exactly
  as Word represents direct overrides.
- Display config → never touches the docx.

A user who wants a particular doc's tags to render a custom color for
*all* viewers applies direct formatting in the doc — same mechanism as
overriding `Font.Color` in Word. No special "embed config" toggle, no
team-wide config sharing required for v1.

The settings UI is itself a substantial feature: live-preview style
editor with per-node-type panels. This matches Verbatim's configuration
menu functionality and is non-negotiable.

**Accessibility customization is the same mechanism.** Per-user display
config is the natural place for accessibility presets — large-text mode,
high-contrast palettes, dyslexia-friendly fonts (e.g. OpenDyslexic),
increased line spacing, etc. These ride on top of the same display-config
infrastructure that handles personal style preferences; we just ship a
small library of accessibility-oriented presets the user can enable.
None of this leaks into exported docs (per the rules above).

## 6. Platform: web + desktop with shared core

Both editions ship from the same core. Architectural rule: anything that
isn't platform-specific lives in the shared core.

| Layer | Shared core | Desktop-only | Web-only |
|-------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Schema | ✓ | | |
| Importer / Exporter | ✓ | | |
| Editor commands, plugins | ✓ | | |
| ProseMirror NodeViews + display config | ✓ | | |
| File I/O | (interface) | local FS | File System Access API + cloud |
| Read-mode keyboard lockdown | (logic) | OS-level | best-effort browser |
| Cross-app capture (Fast Debate Paste) | | OS hotkeys | n/a (browser limit) |
| Real-time collab (eventual) | (CRDT integration) | | sync server |

**Offline-primary positioning.** Tournament use is exclusively offline; the
desktop edition is the primary daily driver. The web edition's purpose is
collaboration and accessibility for users without full desktop machines.

## 7. Multi-doc workspace

Multi-doc is a *foundational* design decision, not a late add-on. Several
features collapse into "have N docs open at once with cross-doc
operations":

- The user's existing side-by-side workflow (cutting-board → structured
  area, drag-drop between panes).
- **Send-to-speech** (a card from the source doc lands in a designated
  speech doc).
- **Block Search results** (see §10) opening in another pane.
- **Transclusion targets** (see §9) needing to be loaded in the
  background.

A single-pane editor would have to be retrofitted for all of these.
Building multi-pane scaffolding from day one (even if v0 ships
single-pane visible) avoids that retrofit.

Cross-doc operations are coordinator code: ProseMirror transactions are
per-doc, but a coordinator can apply paired transactions in two docs as
a single user-visible action with one undo step.

## 8. Editor UI surfaces

Three load-bearing UI elements that we commit to up-front because their
shape ripples into the schema and rendering decisions.

### Default to "web view" — no page boundaries in the editing surface

ProseMirror is natively pageless: there's no `Page` concept, no
auto-pagination, no print preview. This matches Word's "Web Layout" view
mode and is what we want as the default.

We still need to **round-trip page breaks** in the docx, since real
templates include them — most notably the canonical Pocket style has
`<w:pageBreakBefore/>` (`Debate.dotm:word/styles.xml:420`), so every
Pocket starts on a new page in Word's "Print Layout" view. The schema
treats page breaks as **attributes preserved through round-trip but
not rendered as page boundaries** in our editing surface. Hard page
breaks (`<w:br w:type="page"/>`) become a `page_break` inline node that
renders as a faint horizontal divider (or is hidden, configurable);
`pageBreakBefore` becomes a paragraph attribute.

Print/PDF export, when we get to it, can honor page breaks. The editing
surface ignores them.

### Navigation panel / outline view

A persistent side panel showing the heading hierarchy of the active
document, like Word's Navigation Pane (`View` → `Navigation Pane`).

Affordances required:

- **Tree rendering** of all heading-level nodes: Pocket > Hat > Block
  > Tag (and Analytic at the same level as Tag). Indentation reflects
  outline level.
- **Collapse/expand** subtrees. Collapsed state is a UI-only attribute,
  not stored in the doc.
- **Drag-to-reorder** within and across levels. Drops respect the
  schema (you can't drop a Hat into a Card; you can drop a Block into
  any Hat). Equivalent to `Paperless.MoveUp` / `MoveDown` /
  `MoveToBottom` (`Paperless.bas:397-583`) but as direct manipulation.
- **Promote / demote** — change a node's outline level (Tag → Block,
  Block → Hat, etc.). The schema permits these by allowing
  outline-level nodes at multiple positions; promote/demote is just a
  type-change transaction.
- **Delete heading and contents** — atomic deletion of the entire
  subtree rooted at the selected heading.
- **Select heading and contents** — selects the heading paragraph
  plus every descendant. Equivalent of
  `Paperless.SelectHeadingAndContent` (`Paperless.bas:254-295`).
- **Grab heading and contents** — copy (or cut) the entire subtree
  to clipboard, schema-aware. Pastes elsewhere as the same subtree
  shape, not as loose paragraphs.

Implementation: the panel is a derived view of the schema's heading
nodes. It re-renders incrementally on each transaction that affects a
heading. ProseMirror's `descendants` traversal makes this cheap.

### Concrete render fixtures (Pocket box, Emphasis box, etc.)

Some of Verbatim's canonical styles use Word features that have direct
CSS analogues but need explicit handling. The display config (per §5)
ships with these as the default rendering, matching what Verbatim
produces:

| Style    | Verbatim feature | Default render | Source |
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| Pocket (Heading1) | `<w:pBdr>` on all four sides | Paragraph rectangle (CSS `border` on the block element) | `Debate.dotm:word/styles.xml:421-426` |
| Hat (Heading2) | `<w:pageBreakBefore/>` + centered, double underline | Centered, double-underlined heading; page-break ignored in web view | `styles.xml:438-462` |
| Block (Heading3) | `<w:pageBreakBefore/>` + centered, single underline | Centered, single-underlined heading; page-break ignored in web view | `styles.xml:463-487` |
| Emphasis (character) | `<w:bdr>` single 1pt | Inline rectangle around the emphasized run (CSS `border` on the inline element) | `styles.xml:570` |

Round-trip note: these features are declared in the canonical style
definitions, so on export we emit the standard Verbatim style block
into `word/styles.xml` and the document paragraphs/runs simply
reference the style. We don't redundantly emit borders per-paragraph
unless a user has applied direct-formatting overrides.

User display config can override these defaults for personal viewing
(per §5 rules — config never touches the docx). If a user wants a
particular doc to render *differently for everyone*, that's direct
formatting on individual paragraphs/runs, which ships with the doc.

---

## 9. Read mode (view mode of the editor)

Read mode is **not a separate UI surface** — it's a view mode of the
same editor with an invisibility filter applied. Same NodeViews, same
schema, same doc; non-read-aloud content is hidden via a CSS-class
toggle. This is the non-destructive equivalent of `InvisibilityOn`.

What read mode actually does:

- **Hide non-read-aloud content** via the read-aloud predicate (below).
  Implementation: a doc-level class on the editor toggles a stylesheet
  that sets `display: none` (or `visibility: hidden`) on elements that
  don't pass the predicate. ProseMirror keeps rendering everything;
  only the styling differs. Nothing is destructive.
- **Block general editing input.** Trackpad twitches and stray
  keystrokes at the podium cannot insert characters or trigger
  commands. Only navigation and a small allowlist of read-mode-specific
  operations work.
- **Allow inserting reading-position markers** — the one editing-shaped
  operation read mode permits. A keystroke inserts visible text (e.g.
  "Marked 7:32") at the cursor in a distinguishing color (red, by
  default, matching the Verbatim convention). The marker is plain
  styled text, not a special schema node — it survives the
  read-mode → edit-mode transition because nothing about it is
  read-mode-specific, just its insertion mechanism.
- **Adjust display config for podium use** is a user choice, not a
  read-mode-imposed change. Users who want larger text, different
  contrast, or simpler chrome at the podium configure this in their
  display config (which can include accessibility presets, see §5).
  We don't impose a "read mode visual style"; we provide the knobs.

### Read-aloud predicate

The rule that decides what stays visible in read mode (and what
counts as "reading material" for the word-count macro analog):

> Paragraphs in `Tag`, `Cite`, or `Analytic` style, OR characters
> with highlighting, OR characters inside a paragraph that already
> passes the predicate.

This same predicate is shared across read mode, send-to-speech
filtering, and word-count analysis. Single source of truth, multiple
consumers.

## 10. Send-to-speech and speech-doc shape

Speech docs are regular saveable documents — they aren't a special doc
type. They typically have **partial hierarchy**: enough block-level
structure (often a Block heading per send) for the speaker to navigate
via the navigation panel during delivery, but no requirement that they
mirror the full Pocket > Hat > Block > Tag scaffolding of source
files. The conventional assembly pattern is:

1. From a source doc, the user invokes "send to speech" on a Block
   heading (or drags the heading from the nav panel). The Block plus
   all its content moves into the speech doc as a single unit,
   preserving the Block's local hierarchy (block + cards beneath).
2. The speaker drags entries around in the final speech doc to
   establish reading order.
3. The speaker types unstyled bridge text between cards as they
   build their flow. This unstyled text rides as `paragraph` content
   between the cards (per §4).
4. At delivery time, read mode's invisibility filter (§9) hides
   the bridge text and non-highlighted material; the speaker reads
   what's left.

The most architecturally demanding feature. Lives on top of the
multi-doc workspace + cross-doc-coordinator + read-mode foundation.

What a "send" action does:

1. Source doc card is selected.
2. Coordinator applies a transaction in the speech doc that inserts the
   card content at the active insertion point.
3. Coordinator applies a transaction in the source doc that places a
   reading-position bookmark or "sent" marker at the source position.
4. The pair is presented as one user-visible action with one undo step.

Speech docs are regular saveable documents. They aren't a special doc
type. Transient/per-round speeches use a "new scratch speech" affordance
to skip the normal save-flow friction; persistent speeches (canned 1AC,
blocks) save normally.

The "Marked at HH:MM" indicator from stock Verbatim is the same
mechanism described in §4 and §9 — a plain styled-text marker the
reader inserts when stopping mid-card. The send-to-speech action does
not insert it automatically; it's a separate read-mode operation
invoked when the reader pauses. The two actions share no machinery
beyond "insert text at cursor."

## 11. Search

Two scopes, two phases.

**Workspace search (v1)** — across all currently-open docs in the
workspace. Index lives in memory, updates incrementally as docs are
edited. Schema-aware: queries can filter by node type ("all cards
under hat X", "all cites by author Y"), not just text.

**Corpus search (v2)** — across the user's entire evidence library on
disk, including files not currently open. Persistent on-disk index,
file-watcher for updates, larger engineering investment. This is the
v2 priority that supersedes the existing standalone Block Search tool.

Block Search's current capabilities (Ctrl+Space focus, Context View,
multi-select, batch-process, send-to-target) are the feature targets;
the schema-awareness of our index is the value-add over the current
external tool.

Until corpus search ships, the existing standalone Block Search remains
useful for indexing files that aren't open in the editor.

### Search as the transclusion-target picker

Search is also how the user picks transclusion targets (see §12). When
the user invokes "transclude here," the search panel opens in a
target-picker mode: results are filtered to heading-level nodes
(transclusion-eligible), and selecting a result resolves the source
identity (file path + stable heading ID) for the new
`transclusion_ref` node. Same index, same UI, narrower filter — no
parallel UI to maintain.

## 12. Transclusion

Two flavors discussed; v1 ships the simpler one, v2+ may layer the
ambitious one. The picker UX, target identity, and back-reference
tracking are common to both.

### Picker: search-driven

The user invokes "transclude here" from a position in their consumer
doc. The search panel opens in target-picker mode (§11): the corpus
is filtered to heading-level nodes (transclusion-eligible). The user
queries — "impact defense economy" — picks a result, and a new
`transclusion_ref` node is inserted at the cursor.

This means transclusion is naturally driven by what's *in* the user's
corpus rather than by remembering paths. The same search machinery
that powers normal evidence retrieval powers transclusion targeting.

### Target identity

A `transclusion_ref` stores `{source_path, source_heading_id,
content_hash, cached_content, last_refreshed}`:

- `source_heading_id` is the stable UUID on the target heading
  (per §4). This is what survives heading renames and body edits;
  the heading text is *not* the identity.
- `source_path` locates the source doc on disk (in v1) or as a
  resolvable reference (URL, content-addressed hash) in later
  versions.
- `content_hash` and `last_refreshed` drive the staleness indicator.

### v1: refresh-on-demand

Renders `cached_content`. User clicks "refresh" to re-fetch from
source and reconcile. Stale indicator when source's current hash
differs from `content_hash`. No backend; works offline.

### v2+: live shared cards

Same schema node, push-based updates via Y.js + ProseMirror or
similar. Requires backend (or P2P sync), auth, conflict resolution
UX. The schema doesn't change — the difference is push vs pull and
the network/sync layer underneath.

### Back-reference tracking (producer-side)

Producers — users editing the doc that *contains* the source heading —
need to know that destructive edits will propagate. Tracking lives in
a workspace-scoped sidecar index, not in the source doc itself:

- **Storage**: a sidecar JSON file (`<workspace>/.transclusion-index.json`
  or similar) maps `heading_id → [{consumer_path, consumer_position,
  last_seen}]`.
- **Population**: built by scanning consumer docs in the workspace at
  startup, on demand, or incrementally as docs are saved. Fully
  reconstructible from scratch.
- **Why sidecar instead of in-doc**: embedding back-refs in the source
  doc would (a) modify a doc just because someone else transcluded
  from it, awkward semantics; (b) need to survive Verbatim cleanup
  passes that don't know about them. A sidecar avoids both.
- **Round-trip**: the sidecar is workspace-local and *not* part of
  the docx. It's lost when a doc travels to another machine; the
  receiving machine rebuilds its own index by scanning its workspace.

### Producer-side UX (destructive-edit warning)

When a user is editing inside a heading whose ID has back-refs:

- A **non-modal indicator** in the heading's gutter shows
  "referenced by N docs." Click to see the list.
- On a **destructive edit** (large deletion, content-replacing
  operation, deletion of the heading itself), prompt to confirm
  with the option to **"fork the heading"**: duplicate the heading
  in place, give the duplicate a fresh ID, and let consumers
  continue pointing at the old (now-immutable-by-convention) copy
  while the user's edits proceed on the working copy.
- "Destructive" is heuristic, not load-bearing. False positives
  (over-warning) are tolerable; false negatives (silently breaking
  consumers) are not.

### Cycle detection

Required in either flavor. A → B → A is rejected at the picker
stage; if the user attempts it, the picker shows the cycle path and
declines to insert the reference.

### Export behavior — snapshots, not references

When a doc with `transclusion_ref` nodes is exported to docx, each
reference is **frozen as a snapshot of its current `cached_content`**
in the exported file. The exported docx contains plain content — no
transclusion identity, no special markup, fully native to Verbatim.
Anyone opening the file sees ordinary evidence; they don't (and
shouldn't) know it was transcluded.

This is what falls out of the model by default: `cached_content` is
what we render, and what we render is what we export.

#### Implication: re-import drops transclusion identity by default

If the user exports a doc to docx and later re-imports the *same* file,
the transclusion-ness is lost — every reference comes back as plain
content. To get the references back, the user re-transcludes (the
search-driven picker makes this cheap).

This is acceptable for v1 because the natural workflow is: keep the
working file open in the editor (where transclusions persist as
references), and export to docx only for sharing or archiving.

#### Optional refinement (deferred): bookmark-anchored sidecar

For users who want transclusion identity to survive a docx round-trip
(export → close → re-open → still transcluded), a deferrable
refinement: wrap each snapshot on export in a uniquely-named
`<w:bookmarkStart w:name="transclusion-{uuid}"/>` ... `<w:bookmarkEnd/>`,
and write a workspace-scoped sidecar (combine with the back-ref
sidecar from above) that maps each bookmark UUID to its source
identity. On re-import, bookmarks with the `transclusion-` prefix
restore as `transclusion_ref` nodes if the sidecar is present;
without the sidecar, they're harmless (Verbatim ignores unknown
bookmark names; the content is still readable).

Defer until there's evidence users want it; the default snapshot
behavior is the right v1.

## 13. Drag-and-drop on cards/blocks

ProseMirror NodeViews + the standard drag/drop APIs make this
straightforward:

- Each block-typed node renders with a drag handle (gutter affordance,
  hover-to-reveal grip, modifier+click target — UX choice).
- Schema-aware drop zones: the schema's content expressions tell us
  which siblings a node can move between. Invalid drop targets are
  not lit up; invalid drops are rejected.
- Atomic moves: one ProseMirror transaction repositions a node and its
  descendants. Single undo step.
- Modifier scoping (super-drag = card, super+shift-drag = block, etc.)
  is a UX choice on top of the same primitive.
- Drag works **from the navigation panel** (§8) as well as from the
  editor surface — drag a heading entry in the outline view; drop it
  anywhere a heading of that type is valid. Same primitive, different
  pickup affordance.

The Hyprland super+click+drag analogy holds well — Hyprland operates on
a tree of windows; we operate on a tree of nodes.

### Cross-doc drag = send-to-speech as a UI affordance

Drag-and-drop works **between documents** in the workspace, not just
within a single doc. Pick up a card in your evidence file, drop it
into a speech-doc pane — that's a one-gesture cross-doc copy. Same
mechanism for a heading dragged from one doc's nav panel into
another doc's editor or nav panel.

Cross-doc drag and the send-to-speech command (§10) are **the same
primitive with different UI surfaces**. Both serialize a fragment from
the source doc, apply it as a transaction in the target doc, and (for
send-to-speech specifically) optionally fire a paired transaction in
the source doc. The cross-doc-coordinator code lives once; it's
exposed as drag-and-drop, as an explicit "send to speech" command, and
(via the search panel) as "send result to target."

Schema validation still applies: dropping a Block into a Card in
another doc is rejected for the same reason it's rejected within one
doc. Cross-doc drops respect the destination schema.

Performance consideration for very long docs (1000+ cards): only
compute drop targets near the drop point, not across the whole tree.

## 14. Editing semantics (card-aware editing behavior)

The schema (§4) gives us strong structural guarantees: a card has a
required tag, undertags belong to the tag they follow, an analytic_unit
has an analytic at its root, etc. Word doesn't enforce any of this —
its editing model is "every paragraph is independent; styles are just
labels." Most of the time the user's editing actions (Backspace, Enter,
Delete, type-text, paste, drag) are unambiguous, but at node boundaries
Word's loose semantics and our typed schema disagree. This section is
the catalog of those disagreements and the rules we pick.

The general design tension: **Word's behavior is what users have
muscle memory for**, but it can produce schema-invalid intermediate
states (a card with no tag, an undertag outside a card, a Heading-3
that turns into a body paragraph mid-keystroke). We pick a rule per
interaction; the editor enforces it via ProseMirror commands and
keymap overrides. Where in doubt, prefer the rule that matches the
*user's likely intent* over the rule that matches Word.

This section is the source of truth for those rules. Decided rules
live here; rationale (one-liners) goes to `DECISIONS.md` with a back-
reference. Open questions stay marked `[open]` until polled and
resolved.

### Status legend

- `[decided]` — rule is settled; rationale logged in `DECISIONS.md`.
- `[open]` — actively gathering input from collaborators / project owner.
- `[draft]` — proposed by the implementer, not yet polled.

### 14.1 Open questions (under collaborator review)

#### Q1: Backspace at the start of a tag `[open]`

You are editing a tag and your cursor is at the beginning of the tag.
You hit Backspace. In Word, this deletes the line break right before
the tag, combining the tag with the paragraph before and turning the
paragraph before into a tag.

Options:

1. **Prohibit.** You never want to hit Backspace at the beginning of a
   tag and tag-ify the paragraph above it.
2. **Permit only when the previous paragraph is blank.** You might
   want to remove blank space before a card by backspacing the tag
   into it, but would never want to back a tag into a non-blank
   paragraph.
3. **Permit, but the merge inverts: the tag adopts the style of the
   previous paragraph** (rather than the previous paragraph becoming a
   tag).
4. **Word's behavior is correct as-is.**
5. Other.

#### Q2: Enter in the middle of a tag `[open]`

You are editing a tag and your cursor is in the middle of the tag. You
hit Return/Enter. In Word, this splits your one tag-styled paragraph
into two tag-styled paragraphs at the cursor — creating an original
paragraph 1 and a new paragraph 2.

Options:

1. **Prohibit.** You never want to split a tag into two tags this way.
2. **Permit, but only paragraph 1 keeps tag styling.** Splitting a tag
   this way would be because you want part of the tag to be normal
   text below a tag (e.g., recovering from accidentally backspacing a
   cite into a tag). If you want paragraph 2 to remain a tag, you'd
   re-apply the tag style manually.
3. **Permit, but only paragraph 2 keeps tag styling.** The only
   reason to do this would be if you accidentally tag-ified a normal
   paragraph (per Q1). You'd want the paragraph to return to normal
   when you break the tag off of it.
4. **Word's behavior is correct as-is.**
5. Other.

### 14.2 Question backlog (not yet drafted in poll form)

Surfaced during the design conversation but not yet posed to
collaborators. Each will become a `[open]` entry above (or a `[draft]`
proposal) before the F-key style commands ship.

**Mirror cases for the same actions:**

- Forward Delete at the *end* of a tag (pulls following cite/body into the tag).
- Enter at the *end* of a tag (what's the "next paragraph" style? cite? body? new tag?).
- Enter at the *start* of a tag (insert blank above the card, split with empty tag, refuse).

**Same matrix for other node types:**

- Pocket / Hat / Block — same backspace-merge / enter-split / delete-forward questions.
- Cite paragraph — backspace at start (merge into tag?), enter inside cite (split into two cites? break to body?), enter at end (new body? new cite?).
- Undertag — backspace at start (merge into tag? into previous undertag?), enter at end (new undertag? escape into body? break out of card?).
- Analytic / analytic_unit — same backspace/enter questions, plus enter at end of standalone analytic (new analytic_unit? body in same unit? plain paragraph?).
- Card body — last paragraph, cursor at end, Delete forward: does it pull the next card's tag into the body (destroying the next card)?

**Selection-spanning operations:**

- Selection across a card boundary, then Delete: does the partially-cut card survive (schema-invalid)? Merge into the surviving card? Refuse / clamp to card boundary?
- Paste of content containing its own headings: structure preserved? Flattened? Refused if it would break invariants?

**Style-apply edge cases (relevant to F-key Phase 1):**

- F7 Tag with cursor in a card body — split the card so the body becomes a new card's tag? Refuse? Wrap the paragraph in a new card?
- F4 Pocket with cursor inside a card's tag — lift the tag out and decompose the card? Refuse?
- F4–F7 with multi-paragraph selection — apply to every paragraph (Word's behavior)? Just the first? Refuse?
- F12 Clear with cursor in a tag — strip the card wrap and downgrade to body? Just downgrade the tag (leaving the card invalid)? Refuse?
- F8 Cite / F9 Underline / F10 Emphasis / F11 Highlight inside a heading — should heading paragraphs allow inline emphasis marks at all, or only body content?

**Outline navigation:**

- Tab / Shift-Tab on a heading — promote/demote (Pocket↔Hat↔Block↔Tag)? Demoting Block→Tag would need to wrap in a card.

**Empty/degenerate states:**

- User deletes all text inside a tag — does the empty tag persist (with the card)? Auto-collapse the card? Convert to body paragraph?
- User deletes all text inside a Pocket/Hat/Block — does an empty heading persist?

### 14.3 Decided rules

#### Paragraph absorption after card / analytic_unit `[decided]`

A `paragraph` at doc level whose immediate previous sibling is a `card`
or `analytic_unit` is auto-absorbed as a `card_body` appended to that
container's content. To bound a region of loose paragraphs after a
card, insert a heading (Pocket / Hat / Block) — anything non-paragraph
breaks the absorption zone.

Cases preserved (no absorption):

- Heading → paragraph → tag (legitimate bridge text between a section
  heading and the cards beneath it).
- Doc start → paragraph (top-of-doc preface).
- Heading → paragraph → heading (loose paragraph between sections).

Implemented as `src/editor/absorb-plugin.ts`, an `appendTransaction`
plugin that runs after every doc-changing transaction. Matches the
behavior the importer already produces (every Normal paragraph after a
tag is grouped into the card as `card_body` until the next heading).

Rationale: see `DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-09 "Paragraph absorption rule for
loose paragraphs after a card."

## 15. Companion-tool integration boundaries

The user maintains several companion tools today (referenced in
`https://debate-decoded.ghost.io/leveling-up-verbatim/` and elsewhere).
Per-tool integration assessment:

| Tool | Status | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Block Search | **Integrate (workspace v1, corpus v2)** | Schema-aware search is a major win; current tool exists because Word lacks the primitives. |
| Fast Debate Paste — smart-paste pipeline | **Integrate** | Pure text-transformation; portable to both web and desktop. |
| Fast Debate Paste — cross-app capture | **Desktop-only integration** | Global hotkeys + foreground-app reads aren't possible from a web app. |
| AI cites/quals/translate/explain | **Integrate** | Pure LLM commands; cleaner UX with direct schema awareness. Degrades when offline. |
| Stylepox Cleaner | **Stay external** | Legacy-file remediation runs once before adoption; our outputs are clean by construction. |
| Tabroom Pairings highlighter | **Stay external** | Browser bookmarklet for tournament pairings; not a doc-editing tool. |

Meta-observation: most of these tools are *patches around Word's
limitations*. In a purpose-built editor, many of them stop being
external tools and become features of the platform. The integration
question is "what gap in Word did this tool exist to fill, and does our
editor close that gap natively?"

### Verbatim ribbon-command parity

The same logic applies to Verbatim's own ribbon commands. Operations
like `AutoNumberTags`, `DeNumberTags`, `AutoFormatCite`,
`ReformatAllCites`, `FixFakeTags`, `ConvertToDefaultStyles`, and the
shrink/condense/expand family are simple text-manipulation transforms
operating on the schema. They cost essentially nothing to reimplement
as native editor commands and the value is feature parity — users
don't need to bounce to Word for any of them.

Ship native versions of all the ribbon commands documented in
`NOTES-verbatim.md` §3 that aren't subsumed by editor primitives we
already have (e.g., `MoveUp`/`MoveDown` are subsumed by drag-and-drop;
`SelectHeadingAndContent` is subsumed by the navigation panel). The
remaining commands map directly to schema transforms.

## 16. Stylepox handling

Cleanup on import is *opt-in by configuration but defaults to on*.
Documents we save out are stylepox-free by construction (the schema
doesn't admit unrecognized styles in the first place). Documents we
import get normalized: unrecognized styles collapse to direct formatting
or get dropped, depending on what they look like.

The *legacy-remediation* path — cleaning a polluted file before
adoption — stays as the existing standalone Stylepox Cleaner.

## 17. Tournament reliability

The desktop edition is the production surface for tournament use.
Hard requirements:

- **Fully offline.** No network calls in any code path that fires
  during a round. AI features must gracefully degrade (gray out) when
  offline.
- **Aggressive autosave.** Every transaction is committed to disk
  (probably via a journal-style mechanism so the editor can recover
  even from a hard kill).
- **Crash recovery.** On launch, the editor should detect any
  uncommitted journal state and offer recovery.
- **No surprise updates.** Auto-update during a round is a footgun;
  desktop builds need a clear "delay updates" affordance for tournament
  weekends.
- **Spell-check off by default.** Per the project owner, continuous
  background spell-check is a perf concern for large debate docs (some
  source files exceed 200,000 words). Available as an opt-in feature,
  not a default behavior.

The web edition is explicitly not for tournament use; its target is
collaboration and accessibility for users without full desktop machines.

## 18. Out of scope for v1

- Multi-user real-time collaboration (transclusion option 1, live
  shared cards). Defers to a phase that has backend infrastructure.
- Corpus-scale search. Workspace-scale search ships first.
- Cross-app capture for the web edition. Always a desktop-only
  capability.
- Embedding user display config in exports. Direct formatting handles
  the actual use case; team-wide custom rendering can wait.
- Pilcrow round-trip fidelity. Schema slot exists; the export logic
  can be stubbed until a real document with pilcrows shows up.
- Tabroom Pairings, Stylepox legacy remediation. Stay external.
- **Versioning / history** (file history, named versions, branching).
  Project owner deferred until later; standard undo + autosave is
  enough for v1.
- **Schema migration / version compatibility.** Defer until going
  public; while the user is the only user, breaking changes are
  recoverable by hand.
- **Comments / annotations.** Some teams use them; project owner notes
  it'd be nice but isn't a priority. Word's comment XML is not hard to
  preserve through round-trip even without rendering, so v1 should at
  minimum *preserve* comments on round-trip without rendering them.
- **Localization** beyond English. No non-English debate communities
  in scope right now.
