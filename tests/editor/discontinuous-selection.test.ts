/**
 * Discontinuous selection — the data path the Ctrl/Cmd add-to-selection
 * interaction drives. `setManualShadowSelection` populates the shadow-selection
 * plugin's match ranges (merged, empty dropped) and collapses the cursor inside
 * the first, so `getOperatingRanges` returns those ranges with `fromShadow:true`
 * — which is exactly what the ~15 format commands (and the copy handler) consume.
 * The mouse/clipboard plumbing itself is exercised by hand in the dev build.
